# Mathematics worksheet generator
This project is created to generate mathematics homework for the children that I tutor. At the moment I'm only generating multiplications for a year 2 student, but I plan to turn this into a customisable homework generator with mathematical topics for primary school up to high school levels. I also want the users to be able to choose the number of questions as well as the layout of their worksheet.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository and move into the `web-app-maths-homework` folder.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. After that, run `npm start` to view the worksheet generator using your favourite browser at http://localhost:3000.
4. Press the refresh button (or `F5`) to re-generate the worksheet to print.

## TO-DO
*  Add UI control for number of questions (per page and column)
*  Add UI control for range for questions
*  Make this worksheet generator live
*  Add more basic topics (addition, subtraction, division, ... etc)

## Future plans
*  Add generation of the corresponding answers pages
*  Add more topics (higher primary school)
